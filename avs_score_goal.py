# Issues that need fixed
#     . (CONSULT) Figure out how to print the current goal scorer and not all the goal scorers since it'll run through the whole loop picking up each player that has already scored
#     . Since using two different API's to see who scored and what the score of the game is, make sure that the API's update their stats similtaneously so the player_loop() has data to present when scored
